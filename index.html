		    	Hello, I'm Sangmin Kim. Call me "Tyler" if you wish.
		    	<br><br>
		    	I'm a full-stack web developer who's somehow destined to learn completely new tech stacks every time I pursue a new opportunity as a dev. Seriously, zero overlaps for the last 8 years. Though I always had to pick up new technologies... and you know what? I did pretty well! :)
		    	<br><br>
		    	I used to be facinated about learning new technologies in the past... but I'm going the opposite way now. I'm very into digging into studying interpreters & compilers and architectures of frameworks I use for work.
		    	<br><br>
		    	I can keep talking about me as a dev and my skill sets... but let's talk about myself now. If you're interested in me as a dev, please download <a href="files/resume.pdf" download>this resume</a>.
		    	<br><br>
		    	By looking at the game collection(and it's only some of my entire collection!), you probably have already guessed at this point. Yes! You're right! I'm a big boardgame fan. Not only do I own 700+ games but also I have written over 280+ boardgame reviews in Korea for the last 10 years. Eh-hm! Yeah, you can say I'm one of the well-known board game reviewers with a lot of good credits for well-written reviews. If you'd like to see some, please visit <a href="https://boardlife.co.kr/raccoon" target="_blank">here!</a> (tho, it's written in Korean...)
